## Loading dataframe in called "my genes"

```{r}
library('plotly')
library(tidyverse)
setwd('~/Desktop/TRGN-510')
mygenes <- read_tsv('gene_dist_head.tsv')
read.table('gene_dist_head.tsv', header = TRUE, sep = "", quot = "\"",)
View(mygenes)
is.data.frame(mygenes)
```
## Summary of data in my genes

```{r}
library(dplyr)
summary(mygenes)
```
## test graph.r script

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # We load in libraries
library(plotly)
```


```{r}
# We define a factor set of autosomes
autosomes<-c("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10",
 "11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20","21","22")  
# We create a new dataframe called 'genes' which only has autosomes, however we still have those additional factors
genes<- mygenes[ which(mygenes$chr %in% autosomes), ] 
# We remove the factors and then order them so they are numerical order and not alphabetical
genes$chr <- factor(genes$chr, levels = autosomes) 
 # We plot in ggplot 
ggplot(data = genes) +  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = chr, fill = feature), width = 1)
```
## lets go to polar coordinates:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
ggplot(data = genes) +
 geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = chr, fill = feature), width = 1) +
 coord_polar()
```
